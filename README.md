# K-Way Merge Algorithm

In this project, we implement the **K-Way Merge** algorithm, which is a generalization of the **Merge-Sort** algorithm.

The ***input*** is an array of **n** numbers and a parameter **k**, and the ***output*** should be a **sorted array**.

In the algorithm we also use Quick-Sort algorithm, and Abstract Data Type we learned in class called **Heap**.
